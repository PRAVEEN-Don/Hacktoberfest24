# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# This implementation utilizes pivot as the last element in the nums list
# It has a pointer to keep track of the elements smaller than the pivot
# At the very end of partition() function, the pointer is swapped with the pivot
# to come up with a "sorted" nums relative to the pivot


# Function to find the partition position
def partition(array, low, high):

    # choose the rightmost element as pivot
    pivot = array[high]

    # pointer for greater element
    i = low - 1

    # traverse through all elements
    # compare each element with pivot
    for j in range(low, high):
        if array[j] <= pivot:

            # If element smaller than pivot is found
            # swap it with the greater element pointed by i
            i = i + 1
            (array[i], array[j]) = (array[j], array[i])
    (array[i + 1], array[high]) = (array[high], array[i + 1])
    return i + 1
